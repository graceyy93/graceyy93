## Research Interests
Dr. Yang is interested in understanding and controlling multiscale, multiphysics flow and transport processes in fractured porous media to realize the full potential of subsurface energy recovery and geologic repository applications. She develops an integrated experimental-theoretical framework to resolve how fluids are stored, mobilized, and transported in fractured reservoirs across nanoporous rock matrix and fracture networks, with applications to unconventional oil and gas production, CO$_2$ and H$_2$ geological storage, water resource utilization, and waste disposal.
